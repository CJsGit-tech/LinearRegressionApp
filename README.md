# LinearRegressionApp
This is an Interactive Linear Regression App! The structure of the app comes from one of the Udemy course projects that I had. As for the linear Regression Project, in stead of having a one-time deployment, I have decided to create a reproducible linear regression app. 

Feel free to play with the codes!
